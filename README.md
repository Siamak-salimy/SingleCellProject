Ovarian cancer (OC) is a lethal gynecological malignancy with a five-year survival rate of
only 46%. Development of resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy is a common cause
of high mortality rates among OC patients. Tumor and transcriptomic heterogeneity are drivers
of platinum resistance in OC. Platinum-based chemotherapy enriches for ovarian cancer
stem cells (OCSCs) that are chemoresistant and contribute to disease recurrence and
relapse. Studies examining the effect of different treatments on subpopulations of HGSOC
cell lines are limited. Having previously demonstrated that combined treatment with an
enhancer of zeste homolog 2 inhibitor (EZH2i) and a RAC1 GTPase inhibitor (RAC1i) inhibited
survival of OCSCs, we investigated EZH2i and RAC1i combination effects on HGSOC
heterogeneity using single cell RNA sequencing.
